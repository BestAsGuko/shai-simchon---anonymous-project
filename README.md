# shai-simchon---anonymous-project
this is a anonymous script that hide our ip under tor network, checks wich ip we get and from where we are, connect 
to the ip we've get earlier with ssh and that scan him for vulnerbilities with nmap and do whois query.

This script was implemented as an addition to the source code found at https://github.com/htrgouvea/nipe.
